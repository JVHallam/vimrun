## Key ideas
* The exercises must be replayable. Meaning, only the text required for the exercise must be included, nothing more. No lore, No history, No explanations. 
* Use whitespace as much as you can to draw divisions
* KISS
  * Feel free to repeat yourself. Machines don't need repetitions, but humans sure as hell do!


## Standards list:
* There's only one command / combo to be used per section
* Section titles are the commands / combos that are to be done there
* No explantions
* Writing out combos ( v,i,s,p ) is allowed, but telling them what it does is not.
* Each section is 2 lines, then the combo / command, then 2 lines, then an exercise
* Exercises have one empty row between 
* Each file must be no more than 200 lines long
* The exercises should take a semi-experienced user no more than 10 minutes to complete all of them.
