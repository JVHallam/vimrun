* Atomic file structure
	* Each exercise could be it's own tiny little file
	* Have a file that contains a:
		* List of pages
			* Containing a list of exercises
			* A page name?

	* Have a script that :
		* Takes the above file
		* Combines everything into their new files
		* Then uses those for the actions

	* Why:
		* In the future, i want to be able to add hundreds, if not thousands, of exercises. That'll break the Vim run rule of each page only being a few pages long and only 10 exercises per page.
		* in the future, I'd like to add an Anki like system to exercises so that exercises are progressive, productive and fresh. They'd be orderable in terms of priority and would allow me to advance myself, with regards to vim.
		* In the future, i wish to be 100 times better with vim, with only a half of the time required.
	
	
* file browsing exercise:
	* In one tab, you have the list of commands to do
	* In another tab, you have the file browser
	* You move through setup directory and do things to files, like renaming and what not
