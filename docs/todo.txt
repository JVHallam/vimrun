To do
===

* come up with a system, so that i can remove ALL explanations
  * e.g. | x | <= Place cursor here
  * > x, y, z <= Press the keys x, then y, then z
  * --> Line on which to do it
  * ==> The expected end result

--> Example
==> The practise line


Immediates:
* Change --> to ==>
* --> Expected output
* ==> Exercise line
* == Command string ==
* You don't need to name the sections, remove all titles
* gg, G, but also add CTRL-O
* remove the number G and CTRL-G parts
* The search section is just far too fucking long
* == /error => error
* == /\cerror => ErRoR || error
* == n, forwards, errror, errror, error
* == Backwards N
* Remove usages of w, l and x, to just be w and x
* Remove usages of e,j,x to just be e,x
* Remove the section screen jumping
* Add the section on using ":line" to jump
* Swap the A exercises around 
* JOIN => Does it need to be SHIFT + j?
* Only one command per section

* CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FUCKING PROJECT!


* ADd the ideas of the #,# line combo tool
