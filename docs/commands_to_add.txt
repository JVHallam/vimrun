What are the essentials of vim:
  More emphasis on text objects:
    Visual mode and text objects are most likely the best things to focus on.
    Remember, this is to be aimed at the master, who's repeating, 
    rather than the newbie, who'd focused on learning it for the first time.

    Text objects are the most powerful way of selecting things.

    Visual mode gives a visual way to allow the user to see what's going on.

    Combining future commands ( c, d, v ) with the text objects, makes shit way more powerful.

  select a bunch of text, then : u, U: 
    * change the case of a selection

  Macros:
    The section on macros breaks my own rules with regards to 
    kata complexity. 
    This section should be focused on the returning practiser,
    with little instructions. Not focused on the newbie.

  G, and g, and possibly CTRL + o:
    Seperate them. 

  #,#:command:
    This is selecting a block of text by line numbers.
    Pretty damned useful for deleting, copying, indenting blocks of text.

  Chords and multipliers:
    -> replacement, deletion and visual mode are fantastic ways of getting used to the chords involved

  File management:  
    -> file exploration using :Tex
    -> split screening
    -> splits into tabs:
      -> ctrl+w, shift+t

  Autocomplete:
    -> CTRL + P to autocomplete a word, have a quick section on the usage of that

Additional movement:
  CTRL + i 

  These move you around, with regards to previous places you've been. This make shit so much easier to get 
  back to the work that you were previously doing.
