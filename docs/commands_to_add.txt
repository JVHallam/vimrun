What are the essentials of vim:

  #,#:command:
    This is selecting a block of text by line numbers.
    Pretty damned useful for deleting, copying, indenting blocks of text.

  Text Objects:
    These are essential to understanding vim on a deeper level.
    They need to be included and put at the bottom of the file.

  Scrolling:
    Scrolling is actuall pretty useful to know:
      -> Ctrl - U to scroll up    half a page

      -> Ctrl - D to scroll down  half a page

  Redo:
    CTRL + R, speaks for itself. Sometimes you u too much.

  repeat command .:
    -> if you hit '.' it repeats the previous command typed in. Try dft then . on the next line
    -> t his is a line t ha t is full of t he t hings t o wri t e

  Chords and multipliers:
    -> replacement, deletion and visual mode are fantastic ways of getting used to the chords involved

  File management:  
    -> This could be a bonus, level 2 sort of situation
    -> file exploration using the :Sex command
    -> split screening
    -> tabs
      -> gt tab switching
      -> copying and pasting from one file to another
    -> splits into tabs:
      -> ctrl+w, shift+t

  Autocomplete:
    -> CTRL + P to autocomplete a word, have a quick section on the usage of that

Additional movement:
  CTRL + i 

  These move you around, with regards to previous places you've been. This make shit so much easier to get 
  back to the work that you were previously doing.
