How to make the user feel good:
  Time trails

  Points rating systems

  percentage of the accuracy

Shu-ha-ri:
  => Tell the users what to press, in what order
  => Then offer them an explanation
  => Add in the option to run the script, without the tutorial details
  => Do - think - master, not tell-master-do

Text Objects:
  These are actually the final step to really getting to grips with vim.
  These are lesser known, but greater to use than motions.

  < command > < i / a > < text object >

  i => inner
  a => outer

  p => paragraph

    This right here.
    Is an example.
    Of what a paragraph looks like.

    This is not part of the other paragraph.

  ", ', ` => strings surrounded by those types of quotes "string"
  (, [, { => brackets ( bracket area )
  t => a tag block <tag><tag>
  <, > => a single tag <tag>


  You can do things like:
    cit => change inner tag <tag></tag> to start editing inside of that

    <This> This is an html tag </This>

    dip => delete inner paragraph

    vat => to select a tag block ( good for showing the entire tag block )

What are the essentials of vim:

  #,#:command:
    This is selecting a block of text by line numbers.
    Pretty damned useful for deleting, copying, indenting blocks of text.

  Scrolling:
    Scrolling is actuall pretty useful to know:
      -> Ctrl - U to scroll up    half a page

      -> Ctrl - D to scroll down  half a page

  repeat command .:
    -> if you hit '.' it repeats the previous command typed in. Try dft then . on the next line
    -> t his is a line t ha t is full of t he t hings t o wri t e

  Chords and multipliers:
    -> replacement, deletion and visual mode are fantastic ways of getting used to the chords involved

  File management:  
    -> This could be a bonus, level 2 sort of situation
    -> file exploration using the :Sex command
    -> split screening
    -> tabs
      -> gt tab switching
      -> copying and pasting from one file to another
    -> splits into tabs:
      -> ctrl+w, shift+t

  Autocomplete:
    -> CTRL + P to autocomplete a word, have a quick section on the usage of that

Additional movement:
  CTRL + i 

  These move you around, with regards to previous places you've been. This make shit so much easier to get 
  back to the work that you were previously doing.
