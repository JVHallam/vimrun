What are the essentials of vim:
  #,#:command:
    This is selecting a block of text by line numbers.
    Pretty damned useful for deleting, copying, indenting blocks of text.

  Scrolling:
    Scrolling is actuall pretty useful to know:
      -> Ctrl - U to scroll up    half a page

      -> Ctrl - D to scroll down  half a page

  Chords and multipliers:
    -> replacement, deletion and visual mode are fantastic ways of getting used to the chords involved

  File management:  
    -> This could be a bonus, level 2 sort of situation
    -> file exploration using the :Sex command
    -> split screening
    -> tabs
      -> gt tab switching
      -> copying and pasting from one file to another
    -> splits into tabs:
      -> ctrl+w, shift+t

  Autocomplete:
    -> CTRL + P to autocomplete a word, have a quick section on the usage of that

Additional movement:
  CTRL + i 

  These move you around, with regards to previous places you've been. This make shit so much easier to get 
  back to the work that you were previously doing.
