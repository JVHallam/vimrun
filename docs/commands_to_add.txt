What are the essentials of vim:
  Macros:
    The section on macros breaks my own rules with regards to 
    kata complexity. 
    This section should be focused on the returning practiser,
    with little instructions. Not focused on the newbie.

  G, and g, and possibly CTRL + o:
    Seperate them. 

    The fact that they're together means to go to the top or bottom 
    of the page, i have both of them trained into my reflexes to do 
    both things.
    Sound confusing? Yeah, that's how i feel.

    Sepearte them

  #,#:command:
    This is selecting a block of text by line numbers.
    Pretty damned useful for deleting, copying, indenting blocks of text.

  Scrolling:
    Scrolling is actuall pretty useful to know:
      -> Ctrl - U to scroll up    half a page

      -> Ctrl - D to scroll down  half a page

      For the time being, it's CTRL + f, CTRL + u

  Chords and multipliers:
    -> replacement, deletion and visual mode are fantastic ways of getting used to the chords involved

  File management:  
    -> file exploration using :Tex
    -> split screening
    -> splits into tabs:
      -> ctrl+w, shift+t

  Autocomplete:
    -> CTRL + P to autocomplete a word, have a quick section on the usage of that

Additional movement:
  CTRL + i 

  These move you around, with regards to previous places you've been. This make shit so much easier to get 
  back to the work that you were previously doing.
