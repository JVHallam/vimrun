(  /\cerrorr       -> ErRoR  && errorr    )

==> When the guys were writing this tutorial, they used the word "errorr" 
    to empahsise the use of the search tool. I believe that just using
    "errorr" and not throwing in "eRrOrr" and "Errorr" was an errorr.
    You're not forced to try and use the ignore case setting at this point.
    Also, it's an errorr for you not to use hlsearch, it makes life easier
    when searching through a crappy block of text, to find instances of
    errorrs.
    Errorrs are natural part of programming. The best programmer isn't the 
    one who can just avoid making errorrs, but one who can also fix them 
    when they arise.
