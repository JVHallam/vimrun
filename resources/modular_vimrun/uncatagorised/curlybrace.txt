            ( { or } )


  With the { and } operators.
  You can quickly jump through paragraphs of text.

  It's a super useful operator.

  Personally, i'm quite lazy. Therefore,
  it's so much easier for me to bash the 
  } key repeatedly, so that i can move through text
  instead of using the jump queue.
