## What is this?

Vim's hard, unless you know a good amount of it's commands by heart.
Vimtutor comes prepackaged, but it's completely garbage and full of bloated text.

Therefore, i've fixed vimtutor by removing the explantations and adding a few more examples.

## How to run?
* Clone the repo
* Run the script, with vim installed
