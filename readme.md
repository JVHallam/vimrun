VIMRUN 
===

## What?

Vimrun is vimtutor 2.0. 
I've put together groups of exercises
A circular srs system, so you never get the same group of exercises everytime.

You run it, it loads a group of exercises into tabs and you can just go ahead and do it in your own time.

## Why?
Vim is extremely complex. If i spend half my time trying to remember commands, then it's as good as worthless. If i can remember situations in which to use alot of useful commands, then it becomes and extremely efficient tool.

Other tools out there never felt sufficient. Other resources never felt like they quite were up to par:

* Reading documentation alone required me to keep referencing them whilst working
* Vim adventures ran in the browser and restricted you to only the unlocked keys
* Vimtutor is not replayable past the first week

## How to run?
* Clone the repo
* Run the relevant script in the run_scripts directory
