## What?

Vimrun is bash script, that sets up a VIM session with a number of exercises loaded into tabs.
It's a way that allows me to practise all parts of vim, daily.

Essentially, it's Vimtutor without the fluff.

## Why?
Vim is difficult. The benefits of using VIM are very quickly lost, if you wind up on stack overflow every 15 minutes, asking about it's features. Therefore, i created a script for myself, to allow myself to practise more.

Vimtutor was the only alternative i could find, and that was garbage. Atleast 90% of the file was explanations, not a good resource for daily practise.

## How to run?
* Clone the repo
* Run the script, with vim installed
