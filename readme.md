## What is this?

Vim's hard, unless you know a good amount of it's commands by heart.
Vimtutor is good, for the first time.
Everything that makes it good on the first time around, makes it terrible and painful every other time around.
Therefore, i've fixed vimtutor by removing the explantations and adding a few more examples.

## How to run?
* Clone the repo
* Run the script, with vim installed
